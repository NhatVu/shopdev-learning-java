## Section 7: exception hanlder 

- Create an ErrorObject that contains code, status and message. 
- Try to intergrate this ErrorObject with RestExceptionHandler class. 
- A sample is provided through class InvalidAPIKeyException. 
- Now, we can provide custom ErrorObject to ResetExceptionHandler ==> More flexible
- Testing: login api with wrong api keys
